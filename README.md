# A Modular Verifier for Solidity Smart Contracts
SOLC-VERIFY is a source-level verification tool for Ethereum smart contracts. solc-verify takes smart contracts written in Solidity and discharges verification conditions using modular program analysis and SMT solvers.
For more information about SOLC-VERIFY, visit the [github page](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/solidity) of the verifier.
# About this repository
I'm researching the use of this verifier, and decide to create a repository for anyone who is interested in and want to join me on researching.
Also [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dnCD9pb9-V28DcZ5C0-ogNdwLyNmzRPVIIs69mOAss/edit?usp=sharing) is the google docs I'm using and updating my progress often.
Thank you for visiting!
